Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on meth?
Hey everyone! Simple question here for cigarette smokers. Do you tend to smoke more, or less frequently when you are high?

I actually smoke less frequently. When I'm on coke I smoke like a fiend, non stop... When I'm sober I smoke a fair amount... On meth I have a cigarette maybe, every 2 hours or so. Sometimes I think of having a smoke, and plan to have one, but I don't end up putting that plan into action until an hour later haha. Ecstacy is another drug where I smoke less, but because they seem less appealing to me. With meth, they dont seem unappealing, but my cravings for them are weaker, and fewer and further between one another.

When I first pick up, however, and take those first few golden magical hits.... There isn't nothing quite like sucking back a king size export A gold.

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on chal
I smoke a lot when I m high..be it psychedelics or downers or coke,I smoke atleast 2 packs during the trip alone..Its fucking awesome when you light up a fag while you're on codeine..

The same cannot be said while I m sober..a ciggie here and there during breaks of office nearly amounting to 5-6 cigarettes a day while I m sober..

Try smoking menthol ciggies while on ecstasy..!

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on chal
Oh man haha was just thinking about this. Thought about when I first started the shit I smoked a pack in 12 hrs and went from menthol to Marlboro lights to now Marlboro reds which scares me because I remember my very first puff was from a red and coughed my lungs out, now it's as smooth as air -_-. But yes now when I'm spun I smoke less but it depends what I'm doing. If I'm doing something interesting or unnecessarily tedious I forget about havin a stog but if I'm playin poker it's deuces here and there but I know I look like a chain smoker. 
I feel ya on the coke thing which is why I don't touch that stuff anymore plus the depression , or want for more after each line was getting old fast plus icy ice is a better bang for ur buck ;D.
Haven't rolled in awhile but man newports or anything super menthol was absolute bliss while rollin balls. Just one after the other if gettin a light show. Talk about buyin two packs before droppin because I always felt bad asking plus giving was fun haha (hot random girl:I'll give you a neck massage for a stog (@.@) lol
Actually reading this just reminded me haven't had one for a couple hrs I think I shall have one now.
There are times though while spun I actually realize the severity of cigerrette smoking and actually hold back. I have really weak self control sober so yes I think I smoke a ton more while sober.

Sorry a bit off topic but you still using the foil method? Hard to find a Pookie or standard glass oil burner where I live, yet using foil the right way, has kept me interested in smoking it but man does the thought of I'Ving stick in the back of my head. Like damn I can make these last couple of points stretch longer but if I do it wrong that's like 10 slides wasted haha, just a thought

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on chal
No I've been using pipes as of late. I found a shop that sells em really close by. I use foil from time to time if I broke my pipe... I just kinda got tired of foil everywhere, and the mess it makes, and having to "make" little smoking strips.. Pipe is much easier to maintain.

Hey, question for Americans, or to anyone it applies... I saw this guy come up from Washington a couple weeks ago with a pack of Camels. They had these little "buttons" near the filter, when you're done your smoke you pop it, and it releases like a minty "shot" of some sort into your mouth and freshens your breath. Once you pop it, you cant smoke the cigarette anymore though, so you have to wait until its done.

They were really cool, I hope we get them up here in Canada soon.

Anyone familiar with these?

im assuming these arent camel crushes?
havent been home inawhile but last time i was there the only thing was those, that now come in super menthol which is a menthol with the crushable menthol ball and the originals (Basically a Camel light with a menthol ball)
Best camel i cant get out here are camel Blues which is the best cig ive ever had, got a pack last time i was in Europe. 
Miss Camel Reds and the metallic series, Turkish silver,gold, etc.

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on chal
It is Camel Crushes! Those are cool  I like those. Especially when Im tweaking, the taste left in my mouth is very distinct and noticeable. I wish a Canadian brand would implement that idea, if their even allowed to use the idea.

Here in Canada, my favourite brands are in order:

Export A Gold
Number Seven Blue
Craven A menthol
Canadian Classics Silver

I really am not a big fan of:
Players
Pall Mall
Du Maurier


We don't get brands like Marlboro or Camel in Canada.
Almost every brand of Canadian smokes are made up of 100% Virginia Tobacco,
where as most American brands are a different mixture of certain types of tobacco. And that doesnt mean our tobacco is grown in Virginia, Virginia tobacco is simply a strain of the tobacco plant. Most of the tobacco is grown in Ontario for Canadian smokes. I gotta say, I like American smokes a little bit better, theyre smoother. Most Canadians enjoy American smokes. I live 10 minutes away from the border and whenever people go over to the states for gas or w/e, people always ask em to "bring me back a carton of Camels!"

But smoothness aside, nothing compares to the taste of an Export A.. probably just because I've conditioned myself to love it. Theyre one of the most expensive packs here in Canada at about $10-11 a pack (of 20) while the cheapest smokes go down to about $7-8.

I love the taste of most smokes, especially on meth. It's much more noticeable. And it's almost as if I can take drags as big as I want and as fast as I wont and I wont ever cough or feel sick.. Same with weed, when I'm on meth i can take as big of a hit as I can muster, and not feel a thing.. but when I'm sober I'll be coughing like a maniac... strange..

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on chal
Lol knew it! didnt know you guys dont get camels up there, always wanted to visit canada back when i use to speed board (Riding down a steep ass hill really fast on a longboard) i raced alot of Canucks mostly from Landyachtz man i miss racing im sure youve heard of Longboarding seemed pretty big in the BC area. But yea studying half way across the world where a pack of cigs comes out to about $0.50. told myself id quit coming out here until i saw the price -___-
Back home i always switched around whatever was cheaper (yay for dollar off Malboro 27's at shell haha) 
Menthol days:
Malboro menthol/light
Camel wide menthol
Kools
Salems
Malboro Smooths
Camel 9's
Newports

OG cigs
Camel lights
Camel everything actually cant beat there quality and they are pretty successful in tasting unique, smoother drags...damn wish i had some right now
Kamel Reds the box looked way to cool had to try them.
Camel rares which i have never tried but that is on my bucket list cause theyre so hard to find, hope im mistaken but some say theyre discontinued.
(Never tried any of those brands you mentioned)

Oh! almost forgot one Parliment menthols, lights, OGs those were the shit! i try to grab a rim at duty free stores when i go home to visit. theyre fukin awesome, recessed charcoal filter thats cardboard so it feels sturdy between your fingers and i think the charcoal filter is suppose to kill some smell from smokin

Damn my lungs are guna be black when i die -__- grandpa still alive though he started smoking when he was like 12 and hes still alive today at a ripe age of 91...hopefully i get his genes

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on chal
and trying to stay on topic.......

I recently posted about this very thing, regarding my addiction to the 'act' of smoking.

I smoked less cigarettes when using meth, usually because like you, CB, I would think about it and then forget I was gonna light up. Or my hands were just too busy to put a cigarette in. Or, just replaced a cigarette toke with a pipe toke instead.

but when out of shit, smoked way more cigarettes, mostly just wanting that hand to mouth thing going on.

yeah exactly, once Im out of meth and have no more to smoke... I have to be smokin something afterwards, and cigarettes are usually that something. I smoke a lot when I'm coming down, and quite a bit when I'm just kickin', helps keep my stress level down.

I used to be a frequent cigarette smoker - however when I started smoking crystal - my desire to smoke cigarettes decreased significantly. And now, I don't even smoke cigarettes anymore. It's really weird!

That's interesting... Meth did the same thing for me with pot.. well.. I still smoke pot here and there, but before I was a tweaker I smoked stupid insane amounts... Now it doesn't appeal to me as much, even when I'm without meth. I suppose I just sort of replaced it... It's not really the same, people smoke pot to get high, now that crystal gets me high I don't need pot... But it's not like people smoke cigarettes to get high, and it's pretty rare for someone to replace cigarettes with a drug... thats interesting...

Why do we all crave a smoke every little while? Because it calms you, kills your stress.... Meth is also a great stress reliever in my opinion, perhaps you meth intake leaves you in a state of very little stress so you no longer crave the cigarettes as much... That's sort of just a theory but doesnt really explain it fully... You're right that is really weird... That's great though!

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on chal
i dont do stimulants a whole lot. but for me, im fine going without a cig pretty much until the comedown, at which point i start smoking like a train. i just dont really crave them during the high. but if i do smoke one during the main effects, i start chain smoking after that. 
this is only for amphetamine type stims though, with coke i chain smoke the entire time.

Yeh man Export A Gold or "Smooth" as they are now called here (they used to be referred to as Lights) are the shit. Swim doesn't smoke meth but smokes hash and pot frequently and used to do LSD now and then. Swim loves sparking up an Export A Gold (king size only) about half an hour after smoking a nice fat joint. It just completes his high. Being without smokes on acid is also not recommended. )

When SWIM does meth he smokes less too. Mainly because he's more interested in his tweaker endeavors, and his mind and hands are occupied.

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on chal
I never smoked a lot of cigarettes on meth, I never really smoked a lot of cigarettes on any drugs with the exception of methylphenidate. On any given day I can smoke from 1 cigarette to 5-6 cigarettes (rarely) and my smoking habits basically reflect that of the type of smoker which is medically known as a "chipper."

This no longer applies when I am on MPH... I go from a "chipper" to a "need a cigarette once every 20 minutes) smoker. Interestingly enough, if I don't take concerta the day after going through like a pack and a half of cigarettes, I won't crave cigarettes at all. The concerta seems to be triggering some psychopharmacological action in me which FULLY negates my lack of genetic predisposition to nicotine addiction.

Not a fan of Du Mauriers. I used to like them, but they changed them, somethings different...

When I was really young, and swiped a smoke off my mom when she wasn't looking, she smoked
Viscount (vye-count) and they were fuckin awesome... They dont sell em anymore I dont think...
I never see em anyway.

You don't like Export A's? People seem to either love em or hate em.
And I'm a fan of King Size fo sho... They're a little lighter, I don't like overly heavy smokes.
Export A's have a very strong taste, but aren't that strong (Golds anyway, Export A greens can kill horses)

Canadian Classic Silvers are very good  I love Number 7's as well, usually blue, but reds just as good.
Never been big on Bellmonts, but nothing to complain about.

When it comes down to it, I'll smoke any brand, any type, any day - They're never that bad...
Well, I really don't prefer to smoke Pall Malls at all, they leave a taste of mildewy vomit in my mouth forever.
and... Export A Greens are pretty fucking harsh, ever try those Ontario? Strongest smoke available,
"green death" they call em lol

Yeah you're right, Belmonts arent to big out here, you see em around though. Benson and Hedges are pretty good too Id say.. the 100's or w/e its like a super king size, very long and loosely rolled such a familiar taste.. i can taste em just thinkin about em  unfortunately tonight Im smoking Next, a lil tight on coin, and export a's can be pricey, if not the priciest smokes.. up to 11.56 some places! Number 7's, also really good, but also among the most expensive. While pall mall and next I can get for 6.99 and 7.10 respectively. Hate pall mall tho, Next is a good cheap-ass brand, but arent nothin too great. As for in between price brands, CanadianClassics oh yehh, never fails.

And players, I never have liked. The flavour is strong and not a good taste for me, plus their a lil strong for my liking. And some strong smokes are good if their smooth.. But players are so unsmooth I find, it feels like it makes my throat tingle a bit, and "spikes" my lungs if i do a sharp inhale. Just very unsmooth

I hate the new players pack too, the one that slides open from the side.. ive opened em upside down like 10 times, spill ur smokes everywhere... why did they have to change the pack? Why fuck with a good thing, the normal packs can't be any more efficient. People just like the slide cause its different and cool lol.

Im not diggin the new warning labels tho. The white tongue is my favourite.

How about those "slims"? I think their meant for a female demographic, Ive only even seen women smoking them.. lmao a guy cant be caught walkin down the street with a pinner fuckin Slim. haha Id beat him up  ... theyre pretty good tho admittedly.

Also I like menthol from time to time. My ex got me on em. Whats weird, if you smoke menthol for a week, you can't taste the mint anymore, at all.. even next to a regular smoke, u cant HARDLY notice a difference.. Then stop smoking menthol for a bit and try one and the mint come back yayy!

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on meth
Next ciggs aren't sooo bad, did you know they're made by benson hedges? I actually got paid 50 bucks doing a study targetted at belmont smokers. I got 4 packs of next ciggerettes (before they hit the shelves) and had to complete 2 telephone surveys. It was awesome

Re: Cigarette smokers! Do you smoke more or less frequently when you're high on meth
Canadian Bacon, my grandma lives with me currently and normally in Newfoundland. She smokes Viscount extra milds. She could not get the kingsize ones here but in Markham if you know where that is she found a store that sells the 100's.

I actually kind of like Red Next/regular size
Only kingsize I smoke is Bellies, yes CB I used to smoke the "green death" from probally grade 9 till early grade 11. Then went to Peter Jackson reg size/red. Now I usually just smoke C.C's or Bellies.

I hate American smokes. I go to Buffalo games and such and never buy smokes in the States, not even at the Airport if I flew.

Viscounts an old brand though, I never see them hardly. You can actually find Canadian Viscount T.V adds on youtube from god knows when.
