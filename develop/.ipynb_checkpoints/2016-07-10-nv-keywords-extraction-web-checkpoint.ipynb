    "# Keywords extraction from web pages\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to extract keywords related to smoking from a series of web documents. The aim of this phase is to extract important words related to the topic that will then be inputed as hashtags in the search through the Twitter API.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep in mind that we want to find keywords on different __degrees of parlance__, so we first set the levels and we manually annotate a number of web pages for each. We then go to extract key-words from every document using the best approach  in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to do:\n",
    "1. Decide which __registers__ to target\n",
    "2. Manually annotate a series of __web pages for each level__ (around 15 per each)\n",
    "3. __Scrape__ the web pages, parse document and extract key-words:\n",
    "    - parse web document (hopefully always an HTML)\n",
    "    - apply proper algorithm for keywords extraction (we deal with two main types: long-text and forum-like comments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "- A \"multi-level\" well designed list of keywords to retrive on-topic tweets from twitter API\n",

    "[Register (sociolinguistics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics))\n",
    "\n",
    ">In one prominent model, Martin Joos (1961) describes five styles in spoken English:\n",
    "\n",
    ">__Frozen__: Also referred to as static register. Printed unchanging language, such as Biblical quotations, often contains archaisms. Examples are the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States of America and other \"static\" vocalizations that are recited in a ritualistic monotone. The wording is exactly the same every time it is spoken.\n",
    "__Formal__: One-way participation; no interruption; technical vocabulary or exact definitions are important; includes presentations or introductions between strangers.\n",
    "__Consultative__: Two-way participation; background information is provided â€“ prior knowledge is not assumed. \"Back-channel behavior\" such as \"uh huh\", \"I see\", etc. is common. Interruptions are allowed. Examples include teacher/student, doctor/patient, expert/apprentice, etc.\n",
    "__Casual__: In-group friends and acquaintances; no background information provided; ellipsis and slang common; interruptions common. This is common among friends in a social setting.\n",
    "__Intimate__: Non-public; intonation more important than wording or grammar; private vocabulary. Also includes non-verbal messages. This is most common among family members and close friends.>\n",
