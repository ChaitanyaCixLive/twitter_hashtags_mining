What brand of cigs do you smoke?
What kind of cigs does everyone smoke here?

I've been smoking for 8+ years...since I was 16 and I'm now 24. 
My dad used to smoke Marlboro light 100s, and back when I first started that's how I obviously got my cigs, as I was not old enough to buy my own pack. I would take 2-3 cigs from my dad and he never really noticed. 
Marlboro light 100s was a perfect cig to start with, as it is pretty light tasting. I loved them back in the day. When I turned 17 I was fully addicted, I had some friends that were over 18 buy me my packs. 
I thought the lights were too light, so I bought a pack of Marlboro Reds. I loved them and smoked them for a couple years. 
Then I was interested in other type of cigs..I saw Parliaments were a little more pricey than Marlboros, so I'm like they should be better cigs..and I was right, Parliament lights became my cigs. Smoked those for a couple years. Then I came across trying Camels...I bought the Lights, and they were MUCH better than Marlboro lights, they had a stronger and better taste, yet so smooth. 
Ever since 2012, I've been smoking Camel Lights.
Now I smoke Camel Light 99s...I figure why not get the bigger cigs, and get more for what you pay for, same price for the 99s and shorts..it's funny how every cig company took the 'lights' print from the packs..they go by colors now..i.e. Camel Blues are the lights.

So yeah DF, that's what smoke, CAMEL BLUE 99s 

What are you guys smoking today?

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
I like the mellowness of the camel turkish blends. The marlboro NXT were interesting and i get a pack once in a while and usually keep a pack of djarum black vanilla for when I trip on anything.

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
I made this topic, and I recently went back to my good old Marlboro Reds. I tried both hard and soft pack, and believe it or not I seem to like the soft packs better.
I'm not sure why they taste better to me, and they taste more natural. I don't have a problem with the hard packs at all, but to me they just taste more chemically. 

Marlboro Red shorts soft pack is my new Cig of choice. (even though I was smoking Reds back in the day, switched to many different kinds of cigs, but Marlboros are it right now)

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
Right now I'm rolling my own cigs with Ohm Bold tobacco and gamblers 100's tubes. It's been really nice saving my money by doing this because I go through a pack in a day or two between my boyfriend and I. If I ever decide to go buy a pack for the convenience, I have to go for Marlbolo Red 100's.

Not me, but my 92 year old mother who started when she was 16 and still smokes 2 packs a day (her doctor has long despaired of trying to get her to quit.), smokes Carlton 120's. i think she's the only person in the state who buys that brand.

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
Have any of you guys had the Marlboro Eighty Threes? I've switched from Reds to these and they taste really similar. These 83's are bigger than the regular Marlboro reds, but shorter than the 100s, theyre like right in between. Theyre really good and im sticking with these for a while.

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
Today I have tried a new version of Benson & Hedges called 'fine cut' available in my locality but its too lite/light in taste and I will not take this version again. It fails to provide the push when inhale for which I smoke.

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
luckies and sometimes, benson. I can go from one pack a day when im locked up working/studying to almost nothing when im "free"...Its weird but i started smoking pretty old when i was studying in the us, and the "original" american cigs tend to be quite stronger than the same brands produced under license elsewhere....I remember smoking an unfiltered camel in nyc and almost fainting, and not because of the insane 13 bucks they charge you for a pack there...strong as fuck...

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
and when i just wanted to smoke cheap, viceroy...but the price difference around here is pretty small, so it doesnt make much sense to skimp in cigs if you are an "occasional" smoker....at some point i went for viceroys just because they had the lowest nicotine content per cig (they have to put it in the box here by statute, i figured that it was "healtier" haha).....
0.6mg viceroy
0.7mg marlboro
0.8mg luckies and bensons

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
im a menthol smoker, once i tasted a fresh burst sterling my taste for tobacco changed. I started out with Marlboro reds because i had no idea where to start and the difference really and saw my idols all smoked reds haha. but when i actually started smoking on a daily basis was when i tasted Lambert and Butler fresh burst which i fell in love with. My go-to would still be marlboro menthol, my treat would be marlboro black fresh burst. lucky strikes are quite nice too, very distinct sweet flavour to them compared to the dryer taste of a MB. although a sterling fresh burst is by far the sweetest cigarette I've had.

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
I just started smoking since I quit using heroin. I smoke Marlboro Menthol Black 100s. I haven't really experimented with many other brands but I do prefer menthols over all others. I hope I can quit soon. My Father smoked for about 50 years and quit but my Mom smokes. She had quit for many years but when her and my Father got divorced it was game on for her. So now, its Me, my brother and my mother who smoke and of course my uncle on my Mom's side.

Marlboro lights....

I've had several friends who like menthols, but I've never liked them much.

It's always been Marlboro lights, I've stopped and started several times.

I'm back to my usual parliament light 100s. I also have a pack of Marlboro red shorts. 
I just can't make up my mind on which brand I like better, so I always have both now. LOL

Re: What brand of cigs do you smoke?
i always keep a pack of PARTICULARES on my desk, just in case, for when i get a luckies chain-smoking craving ...dark tobacco cigs are more...satisfying



I dont know how my grandpa managed to live 90 years smoking 2 packs of unfiltered particulares a day for like 60 years (started when he was 14 haha)...he was a surgeon, back in the 40s it was common for surgeons to smoke while operating on a patient...
