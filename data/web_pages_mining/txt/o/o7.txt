Hi - my first post.
What are electronic cigarettes like to use? Are they enjoyable ( or as near) as to having a cigarette. With the stigma on smoking now and even I have to admit it, I don't like the smell, I need to start on something to help me quit. 
It looks like Libity Stix gets a few raised thumbs.

I've been using e cigs as a means of getting around my school's tobacco ban. My opinion is they are close, but of course not quite like the real thing either. I'd recommend Green Smoke with the 2.4 % nicotine FlavorMax cartomizers. To me, that's the only thing that was enough to get me a hit. That all being said, it does do the trick, but it wasn't quite enough to get off the cigs either. If you are in a smoke free situation like I am, try ordering some Swedish snus to throw in the mix, that should help also. A combo of this has kept me from going insane when not being able to have a smoke. Works well if you are trying to quit altogether also.

Hi Freddy26

Ive been vaping for about 4 years and at first its different, but after a little time you will choose an e cigarette over reg cigs any day. I use e-juice not prefilled cartridges for a couple different reasons. First flavor choice the avg e cigarette dealer seller pre filled cartridges has about 10 to 15 flavors if your lucky. E-juice dealer / homemade e-juice has double to triple that amount of flavors. Also nicotine levels options with prefilled cartridges for me just dont cut it. With e-juice the vary from 0mg to 36mg on most homemade e-juice websites.

The key for me was finding the right e-juice! I tried store bought e cigs with cartridge and was turned off. I tried highly advervised websites with cartridges and still nothing. 

Choosing the right starter kit is important too. 
I get mine at vaporgurus.com prices are great, shipping is quick and very taste e-juice.I use the eGo e-cigarette bcuz the battery lasts all day without charging. But find what works for you. Anything is better then smoking traditional cigs.
Good luck
Cheers

Freddy26,

It's great that you are trying to find a way out. 

Now, your question - what are e-cigs like - for me and many other vapers they are better than regular cigarettes. I just don't feel the need to smoke anymore. And I am not the only one. 


Are they enjoyable

Yes they are enjoyable, but I suppose this question is: 
what do you think, what are the chances for them being enjoyable for me? 
So I'll answer that one.

Absolutely, if you find the one that is right for you.

How to do it

First, if you are a strictly visual type, you'll probably like the ones that look exactly like cigarettes. 
There is a number of online and offline spots you can find them. As for online, I have a number of them listed on my site. (Left click on my nick - Visit my website). Greensmoke, Eversmoke, Apollo, Premium, South Beach Smoke, Prosmoke... 

If looks don't really mean much to you, you can go for more cost-effective solutons - pen-style e-cigs - you can find the wide variety at Dragonfly (US) and Healthcabin (China). There is eGo Kit at Apollo which is great. 
Style eGo is the most popular because it is easy and economic solution. 

Whether you like e-cig or not also depends on right nic ratio in your e-juice or cartomizers (cartridge + atomizer). 
Eg. I used to smoke a pack a day - today I use e-liquid or cartomizers of 18mg during the day and 12mg in the evening (I sleep better with less nic). There is a range of strengths - 0 to 24mg, even some more. You'll find at Premium and Prosmoke some cig-styles with very strong cartomizers if you are a heavy smoker who would prefer cigarette look. 

Further things to consider are:
- flavors (there is tobacco flavor, but more and more fruit and other ones too. I started with tobacco, and am now at chocolate. Now, this is really a matter of personal preference.

- PG or VG or mix - Some people are allergic to PG (Propylene Glycol) in their e-liquid, so they vape exclusively VG (Vegetable Glycerin). Most e-liquids are mix of the two in varios ratios.
I prefer PG, because it gives stronger throat hit.
VG gives more vapor. Some people prefer that. 
My e-liquids are either PG, or PG-VG (80-20, 50-50). 


Hope this helps.

If you are in a smokeless scenario like I am, try purchasing some Remedial snus to toss in the mix, that should help also. A combination of this has kept me from going crazy when not being able to have a smoking. Performs well if you are trying to stop completely also.

E-cigs are good at vaping as it don't contain any harmful substances and no smell and easy to use without affecting health.

I use an Aspire Atlantis and love it. It is not an "e-cigarette" but a personal vaporizer.
