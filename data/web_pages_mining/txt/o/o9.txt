Long time smoker just started out in the fill your own world and have been reading up on it. Picked up a cheap top plastic wonder since it said it did 100mm, a box of gambler 100mm tubes and a bag of kentucky's red pipe. 
So far I can say this filler is slow and lied about filling 100mm tubes unless by filling it meant 80-90mm in a 100mm tube.
The tubes seem ok other than the 21mm filter is very loose. 
The tobacco isn't bad but strong compared to the packaged reds to the point of taking me back to childhood. May grab a bag of blue and mix it since the blue seemed light when I tried it.

I would like to find a tube with a much denser maybe slightly longer filter and settle on a machine. Seems everyone of them I seriously look at has issues so may just grab a crank premier supermatic or top o matic 1 or 2 for now. Then decide if I want a powermatic 2 or poweroll 2 or jump into something expensive. 
I think a local store used to let customers use a FC years ago. I swear I remember a brown one and at another time another 2x2x2" or so box type machine.

Hi Will, My advice would be you might want to hold off a bit on any major purchase. The FDA has pretty much claimed control of RYO per the recent ruling.

Its looking more and more like whole leaf tobacco is the future route for cheap smokes.

I know I am late and should've tried it sooner. I'm just over spending $200 a month and actually enjoy smoking so I don't see myself quitting anytime soon.

I smoked factory made cigs for 40 years. The last 5 years before quitting, I used whole leaf tobacco. It is more work then using bagged, ready to use tobacco, but in my opinion, you can actually create the perfect smoke for yourself.

Hey guys I could use some help real quick on machines since I want to get one in the next day or 2. Here are my local options but I'm thinking about running to a spot in kentucky with several stores so may be other options. Wanting to stuff 100mm smokes.

Top o matic $38
Premier 2 $35
Poweroll 2 $89 

I'm leaning towards the top o matic in that list from all the reviews for now. The TOM a pound of tobacco and 2 boxes of tubes is cheaper than 2 cartons so I won't be out money if it last that long and does a good job. 

Main concerned with how they actually fill though. I tend to like them packed tight with this little top slider and will toss a pinch of the fine tobacco in the tube before I fill the cavity so it's tight from filter to end. Or at least as close to the end as this fills it.

Is the Top-o-Matic the "original" or the T2? It's the "original" that has had the good reviews. The T2's reviews are mixed. $40 is a fair price.

The Amazon Marketplace seller Gift Guru is selling the Top-o-Matic for $38 with free shipping. Here's the URL: 
http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0024S00VA/ref=dp_olp_new_mbc?ie=UTF8&condition=new

I'd say avoid the Premier -- is it a Premier Supermatic 2?

There's a thread about the Poweroll 2. About a month or so ago a few guys active in the RYO forum bought it around the same time. About half were having problems with it within a week or two, the rest had no problems. You should find and read that thread before deciding.

The Fresh Choice machine is the best personal cigarette making machine of all. But brand new it'll cost almost $500, occasionally it can be found at a discounted price around $450. A used one might be found for around $250, though every now and then better bargains come up. The point is that although it's the best, it is also the most expensive, so you'd have to be sure you're going keep doing RYO before you even consider getting one. By the way, with the Fresh Choice you will have to use king-size tubes, preferably with a 17 mm. filter.

About your question on tubes, try Zen -- they are high quality. In my opinion, they are the best "all purpose" tube. 2nd best, and cheaper, is Golden Harvest.

About the recent FDA ruling, if the worst case scenario plays out, it may still be some time before new regulations get implemented.

This store has the premier 2 but reviews of the 1 seem better in most places after the updated cutter. 

The top o matic is the version 1. Tons of info online but hard to tell user error from machine error. I guess that could be said for all of them.

I read that thread and others that mention it. I think someone was going to post pics of the inside of one which I hope to see. Being a tinkerer and nerd I always like to see the guts of stuff. 

I have actually started a sheet of tubes when I can find the info. I figure i'll try a few but zen,cruz and rambak are some I want to try that aren't available at the local store.

Here is what is.
Smoker Friendly (house brand made by republic tobacco)
Zigzag
Cruz 1 kind
Top
Gambler regular and tube cut
Golden harvest
Shargio

ANOTHER suggestion would be the Powermatic PII - i've gone thru 2 and working on my 3rd machine. The first two stuffed 25,000 - 35,000 cigs each before i retired them. You should be able to find one approx $70 and try to get a PII "classic" or original, not the PII+

as to a quality tube with a longer filter, the Gizeh Extra has a 25mm filter

and here's a link to a listing of cig tubes alphabetical order, listing filter type and length

If you're spending $200 per month, you must be somewhere around a pack per day smoker. For that few smokes, I wouldn't bother with an electric machine that's expensive, or one that may, or may not break. I'd go with a hand cranker. Unless of course, you develop smokers elbow from cranking 

$.02
