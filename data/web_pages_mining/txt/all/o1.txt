Smile cig prices in my state
Hello Admin,
I paid $18.39 at the Shell station this morning for a carton of Pall Mall Lights 100s box style. I buy them mostly from gas stations and drug stores from around $18 to $23 a carton. I'm not sure why they are 7-12 dollars less per carton around here (Florida) than Marlboros. They are always fresh and they come in the new "rounded corner" box style packaging. These cigarettes made by Brown & Williamson are great and I'm saving money too! I love the cigreviews message board too!

Some are dependable; it just takes a lot longer to get a delivery from them and usually you can only get one carton. Some are shipping more than one carton now too.

Yes, It happened. I paid $8.50 for a pack, not proud of it - just sayin. Get your smokes online! Been doing it for 6 years now.

Today, I bought 3 cartons of these from the Walgreens across the street for $15.64 a carton. The price at Publix is $26.30. Hey, I'll walk across the street to save a few bucks. Wouldn't you?

A carton of Pall Mall costs about $42 here... =[

and Pall Mall is the cheapest cigarette I've seen for sale in the UK.

I live in PA and cartons go for about $42-$45 for a carton of camels or marlboros! Prices are insane here. I hate it.
