Default How many cigarettes do you smoke per day?
Just out of curiosity.

I'm a heavy smoker most days, smoking 60 cigarettes (three packs) but some days I smoke about four packs, so I vary from heavy to chain smoking.

I'm a moderate smoker. I smoke a little over a pack a day, sometimes two packs a day.

Usually about 15 or 16 cigarettes per day, some days a few less or a few more. Update: I'm back up to a pack per day. Now that I found some DP pipe tobacco brands that I really like, I'm enjoying smoking more than ever, and that probably explains why my consumption has increased lately.

Default Depends
Sometimes, I can smoke twenty to twenty-five a day depending who am with and what am doing, but these cigarettes are chain-smoked one after another. Other days, I can have only one cigarette or two to last me the day. Really depends what am doing at the time, or who am with

Addiction, simple as that.

Even though my lungs are in a bad way and my throat is closely following I still need my cigarette every 15 minutes.

I am currently trying to cut down. I know I couldn't quit but if I manage to get down to 2 an hour instead of 4 that would be something.

I think finding an activity, preferably one that would keep your hands occupied, that would distract your mind from the desire to smoke every fifteen minutes might be helpful. When I was in the U.K., I noticed that flowers were still in bloom in late November (that was in southern England) . . . perhaps you might try gardening? Cooking might be another possibility. I'm sure there must be something that would provide the desired distraction.

I've tried that having the same thought that it would work, but it doesn't.

Don't get me wrong I cook a lot and keep my garden nice but whilst doing both I still need to light up every 15 minutes.

I decided to see how long I could comfortably go without a cigarette a few hours ago so I smoked a Marlboro Red, recorded the time and went over to my mother in law's (she lives just down the road) for a visit and a chat and after 15 minutes I got the usual "cigarette please" signal. After 30 minutes that went up to "gimme a cigarette!", then in an hour it was "I WANT A GOD DAMN CIGARETTE".

I managed to hold on until an hour and a half by which time I was practically foaming at the mouth and had a cigarette.

I think with practice I could ween myself down to a cig every half hour.
