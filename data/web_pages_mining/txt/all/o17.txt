Unanswered: Acid + smoking cigarettes experience = What happened?
(First post) Hi all!
I have only done acid once (summer 2014) and it was a pretty magical experience. It was probably the easiest drug to deter myself from a bad trip as everything felt in control apart from the visuals. 
Now I've been a cigarette smoker for roughly 4 years (frequent too) and smoke pot maybe once or twice a week. Prior to my acid trip, I was confident that I would enjoy smoking during the experience as I have have always been a chainsmoker under the influence of anything really lol. 
Everytime I have a come on for something I've taken, I always feel incredibly anxious hence I will always crave a smoke as it is my stress reliever, but smoking almost ruined my experience on acid.
It was absolutely horrible.

It was probably my 2nd or 3rd smoke into my come on when I started feeling a difference in my breathing. At first it felt like I was breathing in a bunch of sand, and it tasted AWFUL. I began to worry because it made my breathing become quite shallow (despite being outside in the fresh air) I literally felt like I was going to throw up. I ended up not smoking a single cigarette until I was starting to come down, but it just felt like my senses were so altered to the point that I could actually taste, smell and FEEL everything in a cigarette. Every nasty chemical infused breath I took eventually made me throw up later on. It was just the worst.

Now I have tried doing some research online and seeing other peoples opinions on smoking during their acid trip, and I have never been able to find a similar experience to mine. They've all said smoking is "delightful" and "awesome" during an acid trip, but I have never been more deterred from smoking on a drug until this one. I am just wondering what the possible cause is for this, if anyone has had similar experience? The friend I was with who was high with me was experiencing the exact same thing too, but he's more experienced with acid. Said maybe 6/7 times hes done it, it always gave him the same grainy chemical tasting experience too. 

Thanks all!
- A

Re: Acid + smoking cigarettes experience = What happened?
The possible cause for it might be a door the acid has opened in your mind that leads to caring more for your body.

Other users and myself also report a feeling of being connected to the universe and at the same time with anything you perceive in this moment.

Cigarettes tend to be your stress reliever you say- I guess you felt the fact that it is wrong to counter stress with using nicotine to relax and that ruined the cigarette experience during trip time.

Acid is like a magnifier for feelings. It is not a wonder people completely freak out on bad trips when they felt tense during the onset.

Of ourse thi is only my guess - but I think there is some probability in it 

Hope that helped a bit.

The same thing happened to me on shrooms, friend whom i was tripping with was enjoying smoking pot (and cigarettes) more than usual, whereas I just couldn't, it felt so unnatural and dirty.

Re: Acid + smoking cigarettes experience = What happened?
Have known both extremes on the acid, at times addiction has made itself constantly known and self has continuously wanted more nicotine (especially during LSD + amphetamine and LSD + cocaine) while other times self has dropped then been so repulsed by cig smoke that self decided to quit smoking mid-trip -self has quit many times over a decade, usually beginning during a psychedelic experience, but never for much longer than a month.

What self understands as happening during the experience is modulation in the neural mechanisms through which sensations are perceived; whether affected by psychedelic substances or not self perceives both repulsive sensations to the sensible aspects of inhaling tobacco smoke and cessation of activity -perhaps ionic polarization?- in Nicotonic Acetylcholine receptors. Self under normal circumstances really wants the sensation of pleasure/reward that nAChR agonization provides, but influenced by 5-HT2 agonizing indoles such as LSD self is experiencing constant pleasure and will tend to either cease reward-seeking behavior in the nicotine-dependency game or increase reward seeking behavior by seeking to increase "self's high", "self's pleasure".

What I means to say is that I think the most significant determinant of one's sensible appreciation of tobacco use during psychedelic trips is their mindset going into the trip (what did/do you think about playing the nicotine game before dosing? what will the outcome be? how will you decide to play?). This isn't to say that setting isn't important -e.g. smoking in an enclosed environment will make smokers more aware the sensations caused by tobacco smoke for longer duration or having a to leave a room will tend to make people consider not leaving to smoke, while smoking in an organic setting or around industrial settings expose smokers to smells that limit perceptible differentiation of tobacco smoke from other sensory inputs-, but one will always be auto-suggesting to one's future consciousness what sensations to focus on perceving and which to ignore/disavow.*

*Agonization/cessation of CNS nAChRs could of course modulate perceptual and agonization/cessation of automatic ganglia nAChRs does affect muscle/nerve signaling (e.g. sexual organs), but I have lack the knowledge base to apply such observations theoretically and don't think they are necessarily important determinants of mind-set in most trips.

Re: Acid + smoking cigarettes experience = What happened?
BentSvikja, you describe it exactly as how i feel about smoking then tripping. Personally, i smoke occasionally when using weed, but i don't consume tobacco otherwise. When i'm tripping, i smoke weed mixed with tobacco. I like the effects the weed has when tripping. The weed do amplify the trip. But sure it does taste very nasty compared to smoke weed without LSD. In my case, i smoke so seldom i don't think i risk any disease from it. At least my lungs usually are considered good at health inspections. So it is not any anxiety over doing something bad that makes me feel like smoking taste bad when tripping.

Re: Acid + smoking cigarettes experience = What happened?
For me, smoking cigarettes can really depend. Some trips it has seemed unique and interesting, other times like the OP said completely gross. Smoking a pipe is usually nice though. Either way they seem to bring in effects a little quicker when smoking during the come up. Likewise smoking on the comedown can intensify effects somewhat
