Approximately 4.7 million middle and high school students were current tobacco users in 2015.[1] Although tobacco use by adolescents has declined substantially in the last 40 years, nearly one in 17 high school seniors was a daily smoker in 2015.[2] Substantial racial/ethnic and regional differences in smoking rates exist. Among high school students, white teens are more likely to smoke than are their black or Hispanic peers.[3] Smoking rates are typically higher in nonmetropolitan areas, and in the Southern and Midwestern regions of the country.[4]

Products used by adolescents include cigarettes (both store-bought and hand-rolled), cigars, pipes, hookahs, smokeless tobacco, and newer oral products such as e-cigarettes, pouches, lozenges, strips, and sticks:

Tobacco cigarettes: Nearly 90 percent of adult smokers began smoking before age 18 and 11 percent of high school seniors reported smoking in the last month.[2] Learn more.
Smokeless tobacco: Use of smokeless tobacco among adolescents is less common than cigarette smoking. Learn more.
Hookahs: Hookahs are no safer than other forms of tobacco smoking and may deliver even higher levels of toxic substances than. Learn more.
Flavored little cigars: Of middle and high school students who used tobacco products in 2014, more than 60 percent smoked flavored little cigars.[5] Learn more.

E-cigarettes: From 2011 to 2015, the percentage of 12th-grade students who had ever used an e-cigarette increased from 4.7 to 16 percent.[2] For the first time in 2014, a trend that continued in 2015, more teenagers used e-cigarettes than smoked cigarettes.[1],[2] Learn more.
Many adolescents use more than one tobacco product. In 2015, 13 percent of high school students and three percent of middle school students reported the current use of two or more types of tobacco.

Tobacco Cigarettes
About one out of every three high school seniors reports ever having smoked a cigarette in 2015.[2] However, in 2015, almost one in 17 12th graders (six percent) was a regular, daily smoker—a number that has declined dramatically from its recent peak of 25 percent in 1997 (see Figure 1).[2] Cigarette smoking by adolescents (measured as use in the past month) in grades eight, 10, and 12 combined has declined by more than half since its most recent peak in the late 1990s. In 2014, about one in 17 adolescents (seven percent) reported smoking cigarettes in the past month, compared with more than one in four (28 percent) in 1996-97 (see Figure 2).[2]

Although we may not know all of the factors playing a role in this decline, the 1990s were years when funds from tobacco companies (the result of a legal settlement between the tobacco companies and the federal government) supported a number of local, state, and national anti-tobacco campaigns.[7] In addition, during this time, new restrictions on tobacco advertising were instituted, smoke-free laws and policies were widely implemented, and additional taxes were placed on cigarettes, which inhibited demand.[8] However, after 2002, most states did not allocate funds to maintain the proven anti-tobacco efforts shown to deter youth tobacco use.[9]

Smokeless tobacco
Use of smokeless tobacco products (e.g., snuff, chewing tobacco) among adolescents is less common than cigarette smoking. However, adolescents increased their use of smokeless tobacco between 2008 and 2010. Rates remained fairly steady from 2010 to 2015.[2] Although 6 percent of 12th graders used smokeless tobacco in the past 30 days (in 2015), this is not as high as during the mid-1990s (when use peaked at 12 percent in 1995). Although adolescents increased their use of smokeless tobacco between 2008 and 2011, this trend has slowed and even reversed, particularly for older adolescents (see Figure 3).[2] For smokeless tobacco use, the highest rates of initiation are in the 7th through 11th grades. Although approximately equal proportions of male and female adolescents smoke tobacco cigarettes, users of smokeless tobacco products are nearly all male.[2]

Hookahs
Hookahs (water pipes) are popular among some adolescents and are typically used in groups and sometimes in "hookah cafés." When used in groups, the hookah mouthpiece is passed around from person to person. Hookahs are no less addictive than other forms of tobacco smoking, and are at least as toxic as cigarette smoking.[10]

A typical hookah smoking session is one hour, during which the user inhales 100 to 200 times the amount of smoke they would inhale from a single conventional cigarette. [11] Because users smoke for a prolonged period of time, they may absorb more of the nicotine and toxic chemicals associated with cigarette smoking.[11] However, the dangers of hookah smoking are not well known among some adolescents. [12] Analysis of a national survey found that 24 percent of those ages 18 to 24 believed that hookahs were less harmful than smoking cigarettes.[12]

Older teens have increased their use of hookahs in recent years. Between 2010 and 2015, the percentage of high school seniors who had used a hookah in the last year increased from 17 to 20 percent.[2] Among adolescents and young adults, hookah use is highest among those ages 19-20, and those who live in cities. It is less common in suburban and rural areas.[10]

E-Cigarettes
Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices designed to deliver nicotine, flavor, and other chemicals. E-cigarettes heat a liquid containing highly addictive nicotine and other chemicals to become an aerosol that is then inhaled by the user. The variety of flavors available, such as strawberry, cinnamon, and chocolate, are a primary reason for use among young e-cigarette users.[13]

Prior to 2016, e-cigarettes not marketed for therapeutic purposes were unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This changed with a new rule that expanded the FDA’s authority. The percent of high school seniors who had used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days increased from 1.5 percent in 2010 to 16 percent in 2015.[2],[6]

The same trend is observed in younger adolescents – use among 8th grade students also more than doubled (in 2015, 10 percent had used one in the past 30 days). Overall, among younger adolescents (those in 8th and 10th grades), more than twice as many reported using e-cigarettes than those who reported smoking cigarettes in 2015. This is less true for older adolescents and young adults; the discrepancy may be due to the relatively recent emergence of e-cigarettes.[2]

The parallel use of e-cigarettes with conventional cigarettes is also common. In 2014, approximately one out of four 8th and 10th grade students who used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days had also smoked a conventional cigarette; looking at those in 12th grade, that figure rises to more than half.[2]

There is concern that e-cigarettes represent a gateway to the use of traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products. Eighth grade students who use e-cigarettes are 10 times more likely than their peers who do not use e-cigarettes to eventually smoke tobacco cigarettes. This trend continues to a slightly lesser degree for older adolescents. Tenth and 12th grade students who use e-cigarettes are eight and six times more likely, respectively, than their peers to smoke tobacco cigarettes. This suggests that youth who use e-cigarettes are likely to become tobacco cigarette smokers as they age.[14]

Adolescent use of e-cigarettes is becoming increasingly common.[15] An emerging trend among adolescents is to use e-cigarettes to vaporize liquid marijuana or hash oil, which contain concentrated THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the principal psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. This practice can produce a higher-potency high that can be damaging during crucial years in the brain’s development.

Other Oral Tobacco Products
Newer forms of oral tobacco products – pouches, lozenges, strips, snus, and sticks – are also cause for concern. Most of these are designed to dissolve in the user's mouth, and are offered in candy-like flavors; however, they all contain potent toxins that can lead to cancer and other serious diseases. Unfortunately, there are currently no reliable data on how many adolescents use these newer products.
