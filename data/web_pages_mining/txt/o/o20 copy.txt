Asthmatics smoking?
Hey everyone. A little background, i was born with asthma and the severity changes but is usually "moderate" to "severe". Recently I've had very little asthma issues, but I started smoking 2.5 weeks ago and now my asthma is back to "severe". I'm taking like 10 sprays of my inhaler (albuterol) a day and it doesn't help much. But unless i get really scared of asphyxiation, I'm going to continue smoking as an experiment. 

I started out with smoking 7 to 10ish cigs, mostly camel menthols, a day, and didn't start getting asthma problems till after 1 week of smoking when I had about 12 in one day and a few were Marlboro red's (stronger than the camels). 
I've noticed lately a weird thing, it seems like if I'm having an asthma attack and I smoke, it actually helps it short-term. but that smoking is also making my asthma worse and harder to control in the long run. I have thought maybe it is like the smoke burns up and clears out stuff in my lungs at first, so it helps me breathe better, but it also deposits more junk/causes inflammation so in the long run it makes things worse...what do you think?

So anywho, I'm wondering if there are any asthmatic smokers on here and what your experience has been with smoking, increased/decreased lung function, etc. or maybe you know an asthmatic smoker and can share how it's gone for them. also, how do you manage your asthma while smoking and what's the severity of your asthma?

Post Quality Reviews:
A good question that is bound to start a good discussion. Well done on your first post.
Although I don't approve of or encourage you're experiment with the short-terms effects of Tobacco use in regards to already having asmtha, this said, +rep for progressing knowledge forward by conducting an experiment ina topic that lacks info.

Re: Asthmatics smoking?
Hello ravagingmasses & Welcome to Forum-

Your question is a good one since lots of young people smoke, even with lung problems and allergies. Before you continue in your new-found habit, though, you may want to take the following information into account:

From asthmapartners.org:
"In asthma, spasm of the muscles surrounding the bronchial tubes and swelling of those tubes makes breathing difficult. Some cigarette smokers develop irreversible narrowing of their bronchial tubes from inflammation and scarring, causing permanent breathing problems. Persons with asthma who smoke cigarettes are in "double jeopardy": they risk episodes of breathing difficulty due to asthma on top of everyday shortness of breath from the cigarette smoke-induced lung diseases, emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

Allergic inflammation of the bronchial tubes causes mucus production, leading to cough and phlegm. In long-term cigarette smokers, chronic inhalation of smoke from burning tobacco leaves also stimulates the mucous glands in the bronchial tubes to make excess mucus, giving rise to daily cough with phlegm."

Of course your body is your own, and only you know what you want for yourself, in the long term. I hope this information is helpful for your making your decision as to whether to continue smoking or not. Be Well.

Re: Asthmatics smoking?
Okay I am a smoker and I developed asthma while smoking. You will not have much stamina left to even do normal every day routine. Yes, lung functions will decrease and you will feel tired on least exertion and if you continue you will end up on hydro-cortisone. You will develop sleep aponia and I will say listen carefully to what your body is trying to tell you then obey it.

Re: Asthmatics smoking?
I've been smoking almost close to half of my life and I'm asthmatic. I had very severe asthma as a kid, being around secondhand smoke triggered asthma attacks then. I was on prednisone and 3 inhalers to keep it in check and I had to use my nebulizer I think about 3 or 4 times a day plus my mom had to come in at night and give me a nebulizer treatment in the middle of the night while I was asleep. I was also frequently hospitalized for my asthma as a child. As I got older, my asthma got less severe but it's still quite present and smoking doesn't help but I've tried so many times to kick it. I'd go back in time and kick my 13 year old butt for smoking that first one if I could. Interestingly, I've found that unfiltered cigs are actually less triggering for my asthma. I get Gauloiuses Brune/Brown cigarettes online or smoke either Pall Mall unfiltered or Lucky Strike unfiltered with a cigarette holder so I don't get tobacco pieces in my teeth, lol. My asthma meds now are Singulair (but I ran out of it about a month ago and my doc isn't responding to refill requests and I'm not in the mood to see her) and Advair 250/50 with Xopenex and ProAir HFA as rescue inhalers. I rarely have to use my rescues, honestly. Maybe once a month or so?

What controller medications are you on? I smoke between 1/2 and 1 pack a day (I also use an ecig) and I do have decreased lung function I know compared to if I didn't smoke, but on the peak flow meters I blow in the green range, on the computerized tests where you blow out bday candles, I blow them all out. I do develop pneumonia and other lung issues easily if I get sick, I doubt that would be such an issue if I could quit.

Have you considered alternating traditional cigs with an ecig? For me, that has cut down my regular cig smoking drastically. The days I smoke a pack are days I'm on amphetamines and such. Ecigs are nice too, they're not offensive so if say you smoke indoors and have company over and have that nicotine itch you can pull that out and it's also a conversation piece, a lot of people are curious. You can also stealth vape with them, haha. Plus the flavors. I love the combo of what's called "555" or Triple 5, a little vanilla and a tiny touch of a flavor called RY4 which is toffee-ish. 555 is a tobacco flavor and I like to sweeten it usually. Sometimes I don't. I have one supplier who in my opinion has the best e-liquids out there. Their ecigs are great, too.

I would maybe give that a try? Some people have actually kicked their cig habit with ecigs. Me, I use both, but it's cut my smoking down a ton. I was a two pack a day smoker.

Hope that was helpful for you somehow. 

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not condoning smoking, but I know how hard it is to quit and I'm a person who is like the description of what the OP asked how they managed. Not smoking obviously is the best.

Re: Asthmatics smoking?
I've been smoking almost 10 years and have asthma. I had allergic asthma before I started smoking and I have a lot of respiratory problems. I've noticed that if I don't smoke for an extended period of time, I have more trouble breathing and have to use my inhaler more. I avoid using my inhaler as much as possible due to the fat that I'm allergic to it. As long as I'm not chain-smoking, I seem to be fine. The doctors are constantly trying to get me to quit and when I finally did, I almost ended up in the hospital. I got pneumonia so bad that my oxygen levels where in the 80s and the inhalers and steroids weren't helping. My anxiety was also through the roof which wasn't helping either. When I started smoking again, I started getting better and no longer needed the inhalers. It may just be in my head, but I honestly think smoking helps keep it under control. Secondhand smoke aggravates it and so does other allergens and vigorous activities. I don't think it's a good idea for those with asthma to smoke or be around someone who does. And if I wouldn't get so sick and I wasn't so addicted, I would quit myself. I wish I never would've started smoking in the first place, hindsight is always 20/20. Can't change the past. Don't follow my lead, if you don't smoke, don't start, and if you do, do whatever it takes to quit. Nothing is more painful than the feeling when you can't breath.

Re: Asthmatics smoking?
Hello, Ravagingmadness!
Not only do I have asthma, I had a pneumothorax this past spring! 
I've been smoking since I was 13 years old. I smoke a bit south of a pack per day.
My asthma is fairly moderate. My allergies make it worse, and that on top of cold air in the winter, makes it hard to deal with. Having difficulty breathing has become something that I am now used too. The only thing I am afraid of is having another pneumothorax.

Re: Asthmatics smoking?


Talk about creepy and how far the medical world has come on the connection between smoking and asthma, here are some ads form old-fashioned "Asthma Cigarettes" that were publicly sold in ads from 1800-1985. Hard to believe be true.

I have asthma and smoke too. I had the same feeling of when I got short breath, the cigs seem to sooth instead of aggravating the shortness of breath. My doctor's explanation is that when your lung feel a mild crisis, the smoke from the cigs feels so bad for the lungs that they kinda "reboot" to function better to compensate the damage being done.

I'm completely addicted to cigarettes, but when you engage on something that requeires you to absorb more oxygen, avoid smoking at lest for a period after, wait to your breath to settle.

Oh, and if you use some medication, especially that little pumps, wait at least 20 min to smoke after using it cause it makes your bronchi to enlarge and they get filled with smoke.

Re: Asthmatics smoking?
I am an asthmatic as well. I grew up around smokers. My parents, all their friends, grandparents...everybody.

Your question about why it seems easier to breathe is probably due to the menthol. Menthol is a mild anesthetic, so what you're feeling are the cooling, anesthetic properties on your lungs. It make actually make breathing a little easier while you are smoking. That is also why the marlboros were seemingly harder on your lungs, since they do not contain menthol.

Re: Asthmatics smoking?
My asthma was under control for years, (I am 20) I had to take sulbutamol twice a day however never needed my reliever. I unfortunately went on holiday and smoked for roughly 4 days,,,However since then I now have a constant wheeze which my inhalers will not get rid of. I have been to the GP throughout November and December however nothing has helped, been on 2 courses of steroids with little improvement. Am now on 250 seratide and there is some mild improvement however it is not relived breathing as I once had before. Anyone have anything similar after stopping or starting to smoke? I have not smoked anything since. Anyone had improvements. Not sure how to proceed now with getting my breathing back to normal

Re: Asthmatics smoking?
I'm asthmatic and I do indulge in cigarette smoking at least a few times every week.

I haven't noticed any major changes, unless I smoke heavily on a particular night. (For me, that's half a pack or more in a few-hours, often drunken, time span.)
