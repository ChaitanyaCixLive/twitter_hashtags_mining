Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
Hey all peoples of this here place,

I will start off describing my usage of cigarettes. Currently i am 18 years old, and began smoking consistently shortly after turning 13. So about 5 years total of addiction. I absolutely LOVED them, and for two years thoroughly enjoyed each and every single cigarette i smoked.
But as time went on, i began to slowly hate them, although i will always probably love them,
and i now mostly hate them, and intend to quit this weekend (tomorrow into monday).

I find it astonishing, the amount of aged cigarette smokers who seem to possess no qualms about their habit. Who seem to enjoy each and all cigarettes, and report no complications from their prolonged addiction. Yet, i'm still a kid, i fucking hate not being able to breathe, and hate being so fiendish, it is so anxiety-inducing.

Anyway, i guess i am basically calling all smokers to report on how they feel about their addiction/habit, how it has affected them, if at all, and just generally your relationship with these devilish, delicious cancer sticks.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
I first started smoking when I was 12--a couple of years before filter cigarettes hit the market. So, it was Camels, Lucky Strikes, Pall Malls, Kools and a few other brands. I'm 69 now. I still smoke. However, during my life, knowing the risks involved with smoking, I took several breaks from smoking, averaging 5 years apiece. 

I consider smoking cigarettes a habit, not an addiction. But I enjoy them. And they are an automatic excuse for taking a break at work. Where I currently live, SE Texas, I would say there is a larger percentage of smokers than where I used to live, Southern California. 

I'm also a hard drug user, but not addicted. If it came down to my last $25, I would opt for the cigarettes, rather than 1/4 gram. Writing this post was a good excuse to light up, but my cigarette is almost smoked up, so end of this message.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
I regretted both times I picked up cigarettes. I will regret it even more when I stop after my PAWS has run it's course. If my dad can go through what he is and has to stop, well then I sure in the fuck can stop two hard addictions.....and will, but for sure not till the opiate withdrawals are for sure over. Right now, smoking helps A LOT when I feel shitty.

Yep, regret it, and yep, I think most people do.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
Well, at age 12 I had smoked a few cigarettes here and there, mostly with friends to look cool, at 14 I started smoking regularly to try and impress a girl who also smoked, fast forward 14 years, I'm still smoking even after numerous attempts to quit, I can't run more than a hundred feet without getting winded, walking up hill sucks, my breathing in general is horrible, and in probably 8 years I'll most likely have to use oxygen if I haven't quit by then. Funny thing is I've had problems with numerous substances (pain pills, meth, cocaine, alcohol, xanax) but have quit those easier than cigarettes.

I've kinda quit for a couple months about 4 times each time I try, but my downfall is getting around my friends, every friend I have smokes cigarettes, and when I go around them after being quit for 2 or 3 months, that itch comes on telling me I need one just one randall, go ahead you'll be fine, but it's never fine. I guess we all quit eventually though.

Anyways, I hope everyone the best in quitting this horrible drug that doesn't even get you high (and I think that's what pisses me off the most, I'm not even getting off while killing my lungs)

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
I don't regret it. I started at 12 but didn't do it regularly until I was 15. So ten years. I enjoy cigarettes. They taste good (well, not menthols), they feel good to smoke, they decrease my appetite, they relax me. Yeah, my breathing isn't as good as it could be and the two times I quit for a good period (about a year each time), I could do physical things easier, but I still don't regret it. 

That said, if I don't have the money for them or if it's a choice between cigarettes or drugs/alcohol, I can go without and I don't have bad withdrawals. I don't know why, most people do, but for me it's almost exclusively just cravings. No insomnia or depression. Well, my anxiety gets a bit worse (unless I'm high/drunk) but I honestly could quit if I wanted to. I just don't want to.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
Please please rethink the cigs, nicotine, tobacco. There's so much stuff you can have fun with. you may be thinking you can stop any time but you can't they (big cig companies) have invested a lot of time and effort to ensure you don't. If you think I'm a ditzy know nothing think again - read my blog it's all true - I wish it wasn't. Have a life that's yours - impossible when hooked up to oxygen bottle - that's my wish for all of you smokers and I am a recovering smoker too! You never stop occasionally wanting but life is so much better when you can breathe! Go your hardest and enjoy life hugs from ole buzybee xx

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
Big. F'in. Waste. Of Money.

I regret it wholesomely. There are days where I find it to be a compulsion to smoke. Then I go abuse my body some via exercise and see the brown and black coming out my lungs in response to that crap. You just learn quickly that you hinder your ability to function by smoking.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
I can't speak for everyone, I can believe there are smokers who don't regret smoking, but I do know that it's a lot easier to lie to yourself about an addiction than it is to face the facts. 

Facing the facts of addiction means you have to either 1) quit, or 2) do something you know is an awful idea daily but try to make sense of it to yourself somehow. 2 is the easier option. Especially when it involves chemical release, and getting to do something like smoke cigarettes. And let's face this fact - apart from the negative side effects smoking cigarettes is totally awesome.

I would say the vast majority of smokers or ex-smokers (like myself) I have met regret it. As a person who has dealt with substance problems and has heard all of the excuses and evasions and justifications coming from his own mouth, I can say that pretty much all of the smokers who don't say they regret it are either still relatively young or sound a lot like I did when I was justifying something I knew was wrong and secretly regretted. I have recited all of the lines and I know them when I hear them.

Having said that, regret is a tricky word and I think it describes an emotion some people are just incapable of. So the true no-regret crowd is certainly out there. As are people who just haven't gotten around to regretting it yet.

Of every drug I have ever tried tobacco has the lowest benefit to negative side effect ration. Statistically it is the most dangerous drug known to man yet it is one of the most mild, comparable to caffeine which has a very high benefit/neg side effect ratio. Tobacco is essentially useless apart from as an insecticide. No medical value like other awful drugs like heroin or meth, no health benefits, weak short-lived high...

But man, smoking cigarettes is totally fucking awesome. Too bad it sucks so much.

Post Quality Reviews:
Funny, ironic, full of insight--and so damned true! We love to hate smoking, and hate to love it. Crazy, huh?

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
I don't regret it at all. Sure I have asthma and my asthma is getting worse, but I don't smoke very often, but when I do I tend to smoke 2-3 just because I love being outside and just thinking about everything that is going on in my life. Tbh if it wasn't for cigs I'd probably be in a mental hospital right now because I just got through an extremely stressful and painful time. Was going berserk and punching shit in my room to the point to where parents almost called the police. I would rather become dependent on nicotine rather that a benzo. I'm sure one day I'll quit one day, but right now I'm just enjoying it.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
I smoke one or two a day, after quitting for over a decade. I chew cinnamon nicotine gum avidly. Yeah, I regret being a nicotine addict. Nicotine is highly addictive. Giving up the cigarettes would be far easier than givng up the long term gum habit. Considering nicotine increases the risk of blood clots post op,
as does getting a total knee replacement. I'll have to wean off the gum via patches, before my second total knee replacement in March.

Being pissed at my compulsive gambler husband (he seems in a remission stage lately) at the casino, i smoked a cigarette after over a decade. Since state smoking laws don't apply on the reservations, being in that environment and angry made smoking seem sane. 

For those who want to quit, never give up trying, as it takes several attempts. Also, if I buy a pack i
ended up giving them away. My son said, " Who are you the cigarette Santa Claus?". Therefore, I either keep a pack in my husband's desk at work, go to the loosie store or ask someone if I can buy one off them for a buck. I'm an out of site out of mind girl.

There should be a Nicotine section, considering the drug isn't always sourced through cigarettes.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
I picked up smoking at the age of seven(I know that's horrible to hear) didn't start inhaling until nine or ten. You know, the whole adults do it so it must be cool. So 20 years later and I still don't see an end to my addiction though I do plan on quitting some day.

As far as problems with it, I of course can't breathe optimally, but I was born with a collapsed lung and never had the best breathing capabilities. The worst issues I have aren't health related. My wife hates it though she puts up with it. Smelly clothes that everyone can tell your a smoker, and after an all nighter on adderal or pain meds I get horrid nicotine stains on my fingers being like a chimney when under the influence.

I hope to quit someday. My grandfather whom I never met because he died before I was born died of lung and throat cancer. Though he smoked big fat cigars. From what I'm told he would smoke ten to fifteen a day. I don't want to become only a story to my future grandkids. I want to be in their lives, but atleast my daughter is only a few months old so I still have time.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
Personally I dont regret it, I feel like my life has no meaning all the time so I have made my meaning in life to have fun with drugs and with smoking it gives me something to do and gives me a little bit of meaning. I know its sounds stupid but thats just my mentality. Please dont hate aha

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
I recently told my kids, 9&11, that starting cigarettes is my greatest regret in life.
and I mean that.

I regret it more than anything I have ever ever done.

smoked my first cigarette age 8.probably wasn't doing it right,but I didn't care.it made me feel older,more mature, SMH.

By age 13 I was spending my lunch money on cigarettes.

to this day I managed to go a whopping 8 months without.it was during my second pregnancy.
which was the only pregnancy I actually planned for,go figure.

I know that eventually the cigarettes will be the death of me.and I rue the day I ever touched them.

so I tell my kids the smartest thing they can do is to never start.

Re: Cigarette smokers: Who doesn't regret picking up the habit?
i do not regret starting to smoke hooka,pipe,cigarettes.
i smoke since i was 12 years old,which was the first time that i experienced the pleasures of nicotine and eugenol,from the kretek cigarettes that i tried in my early years,and also the menthol marlboros of course.
now whith less than # years old i still smoke hooka,pipe and cigarettes.
And i still enjoy the tasty flavour of the kretek cigarettes and mentholated ones,i still love the taste of the chinese cigarettes that i buy online,which they come in flavours of flowers,raspberry,and all sort of fruits.
my favorittes are Camel and Benson and Hedges and Gauloises non filter.
I do not regret starting to smoke because i know that i have with me nicotine patches to help me quit the habit when i choose to.
And because the habit had not brought to me prejudices in my life,ohh well despite the cost of them beig not cheap nowadays.
