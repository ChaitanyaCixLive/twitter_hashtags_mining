How much does smoking cigarettes, especially Newport shorts, ease withdrawal?
Hi, I am new here. I have been abusing hard drugs and alcohol for 12 years but have been addicted to opiates, now heroin, for the last 4. I have suffered one tragedy after another for the last 20 years, to much to explain now, but I describe it all in my bio. I am trying rehab next month for the first time. What I want to know is, I am a social smoker, and really enjoy it, but have been told to bring plenty of cigarettes to rehab, it will help so much. The girl who told me said Newports literally got her through detox and rehab. Newports are my favorite anyway, so that's what I would take anyway. How true is this? Does smoking cigarettes ease withdrawal, and since Newports are so strong, will they help more than others? I remember EVERYONE at NA chainsmoked Newport shorts and were always offering and encouraging. Please help guys, I have tried quitting smack 7-8 times this year alone and can't get past a day or two. I need every extra benefit I can get.

Re: How much does smoking cigarettes, especially Newport shorts, ease withdrawal?
Good for you & your decision to detox from heroin!

I have never been to rehab, a detox facility, but I have gone through heroin withdrawal. Considered going thru a detox center & rehab, but the addiction specialist/expert had me so infuriated by her lack of knowledge, during our meeting, that I respectfully told her to fuck off & I'd do it alone. This was a very personal decision & it worked for me. Can not & would not tell anyone else to take the same route I did.

From what I understand, rehab facilities encourage smokers to bring plenty of cigarettes because they only want to tackle the prominent issue. In you as, as with mine, that would be the heroin addiction. In other words, better to be a smoker than a heroin addict. In a health only prospective, I'm not sure i agree with that, but that's a whole different conversation!

As a cigarette smoker & heroin addict, that's not currently using heroin...I do not think cigarettes helped me at all during acute opiate withdrawal. Actually I was so extremely, violently ill, that I barely smoked at all. Have been a pack (or more) a day smoker for over half my life & i went a good 5 days on a single pack of smokes.

If you're a social smoker, you may want to bring smokes with you. If you enjoy smoking, that is. After all you're giving up heroin & should treat yourself to something you enjoy! Plus, I'd make a wager (and I'm no gambler) that there will be A LOT of cigarette smokers there. This means lots of socializing outside, around the ashtray.

Just be cautious as you certainly don't want to swap one nasty habit (heroin) for another nasty habit (cigarettes!)

I was a social smoker too I thought, but once I quit heroin I soon chucked the smokes as I no longer wanted them and they were only good as a chaser for me. But they did help a bit for a few weeks after I kicked H. Good luck at rehab man.

Re: How much does smoking cigarettes, especially Newport shorts, ease withdrawal?
I've been to detox and rehab and I'm glad you decided to check yourself in. I agree with frmr that smoking is not much of a help when you're detoxing (dope sick) on your own. A good thing being in a facility they will probably give you suboxone or methadone. I always had trouble sleeping in unfamiliar places and rehabs of late that I've been to only give you the bare necessities. I wish you the best. How long will you be there?

Re: How much does smoking cigarettes, especially Newport shorts, ease withdrawal?
Like everybody else said it's not going to help with withdrawel, but the main draw of smoking in rehab is having something to do. Rehab get's tedious when you have meeting after meeting so smoke breaks inbetween give you a nice chance to enjoy a cigarette and have conversation with everybody there.

Re: How much does smoking cigarettes, especially Newport shorts, ease withdrawal?
Thank you for all the posts so far. I hope to hear plenty more opinions. I will be doing 28 days rehab. I should have said that I smoked from 12-25 but stopped buying packs, too pricey and cut into dope expenditures. I really want to thank Fmrjunkie for a very thoughtful and detailed entry. I do plan on bringing several cartons with me. 

What about after getting clean? How much has smoking helped everyone from relapsing? I certainly plan on continuing after rehab is over. Will I have a better chance of success if I replace heroin with cigarettes? 

And I apologize Fmr for calling u 47, I meant 40. Hope ur not mad. Your profile greatly interests me, much seemingly in common. Music lovers, college-educated... Your post sounds very intelligent and analytical.

Everyone, keep those answers coming! Thanks to all.

Re: How much does smoking cigarettes, especially Newport shorts, ease withdrawal?
It's hard to say what will happen when you get out. They always recommend 90 meetings in 90 days but I didn't listen. I relapsed and opiate dependency ruined my spirit. I would get back home and take a drink of wine and it tasted like kerosene but drank anyway. I needed to support group. You can bring loads of cigarettes but they might only take you for smoke breaks 5-6 times a day.

Totally not related but a side note: My first stint in rehab as a teenager was for 90 days. Back then, they let you smoke indoors, even my psych doctor smoked. You just weren't supposed to be able to keep a lighter because it was a psychiatric hospital. Yes, they put teenagers in the same ward with adults with severe mental health conditions. Things have certainly changed since then.

Re: How much does smoking cigarettes, especially Newport shorts, ease withdrawal?
LOL i'm not mad! sometimes i get mischievous when people inquire about my age & lie, but instead of lying down like so many women & having someone think to themselves wow, she looks liks shit for 28, i lie up so they exclaim damn, you look fantastic for 47!   here's the gist of my message...i have to go to sleep. rarely check my email, but check in here a few times (or more) a day. unsure if you can only send messages once an hour or receive once an hour, or both. i'll read some site functions tomorrow. i only joined the site November 20, 2012.

well, i can def. relate to the loss of family  mine is all deceased, including my sibling; i have no close blood relatives. this past year alone i lost 3 very good friends, of over 20 years, to cancer. so yes, i can very much relate to your losses. sometimes it feels like that's all i know is loss. really i'm almost afraid of making new friends as there's an underlying fear that they'll soon die. sometimes it feels safer to be alone, that somehow there's something wrong with me that so many people i've loved have died. i know this isn't fact, but sometimes it feels that way.

as far as smoking to help during withdrawal (will shorten to wd for ease of typing), no it didn't help me at all. i was an iv heroin user (shot up in my veins.) the heavy wd started about the 3rd day & lasted until day 8-9. honestly, i don't remember much about those days. my habit was huge, like yours, i was dropping $200 daily. i was extremely sick, but getting clean was well worth the short period of suffering i endured!

yes, i love smoking! started smoking at 13 & have smoked a pack, or more, a day since. don't really worry about the health consequences of smoking. i enjoy it, it's my only bad habit anymore & hell i gotta die from something! LOL never really worried about the health consequences of heroin use either though. By looking at me, you'd never known i was a junkie. Had my own, very successful, small business & have always been a very clean person. I was extra cautious with my hygiene & safety. Never shared any equipment & i was so picky i wouldn't even re-use my own needles, cookers, cottons.

As for health consequences of heroin use...there's actually no scientific evidence that use of opiates is bad for you. my personal opinion, be it right or wrong is that health problems arise from what the dope is cut with & the biggest problem, with iv heroin, is poor hygiene. also with people that abuse prescription pain meds the tylenol & whatnot causes liver damage.

don't get me wrong, i'm not advocating you should stay an addict. beyond health issues, there's too many other problems that occur from trying to live a balanced life & juggling heroin use. unless you're a recluse multi-billionaire it's likely not possible to lead any kind of fulfilling life & be a heroin addict. i quit using in May 2010. used once since then which i refer to as a momentary lapse. i'm not perfect & am not ashamed of this. the way i see it is that i didn't keep using that day which easily could have. did one dose out of the pack & flushed the rest down the toilet.

Now back to you. YES YOU CAN QUIT!!!! most importantly you have to want to quit. once you have the desire to quit, well you just need to find the route that works for you. what works for one person won't always work for another. some people need detox, rehab, meetings, suboxone, methadone, sober living homes & so on, others do not. if you try one route & wind up relapsing, please don't let that discourage you. relapse can be a vital, integral part of getting & staying clean. like learning to ride a bike, as a child...if you fall down you don't just give up do you? HELL NO! you get band aid's slapped on your wound's & you get right back on that bike!

Re: How much does smoking cigarettes, especially Newport shorts, ease withdrawal?
So, Carter:

What finally helped you stay clean? Did the cigarettes help in rehab for you? You were so lucky though, you could smoke all day long. How much did you smoke during your stay? Still smoke now? Are cigarettes a good replacement for smack? When you would get a craving, would smoking help take it away? How long have you been clean?

My first stint was a phenomenal failure. Back then they gave us weekend furloughs where you get to go home Friday and return Sunday. Of course I got high with my sister and friends (weed/acid/alcohol). My parents were oblivious because they were drunk alot of the time. It wasn't until later in life that I got hooked on opiates- anything I could get my hands on. 

I had a stable state job and would go home on my lunchhour bump or speedball, have a cigarette and go back to work wasted as hell sometimes. In an office full of non-smokers, I would hear comments "Eww someone stinks like cigarettes!" But the addiction to drugs made me stop caring. We had new management and they didn't like me and I really didn't like them either. I got to the point where once I didn't even show up or call. I checked myself in again. So yeah, even though that was my last rehab in 2009, they fired my ass. I could have fought for my job back but my self-esteem was so bad. Earlier that year, my dad died unexpectedly. They never even gave me a damn sympathy card. Just um, when you coming back?

I can so relate to you guys losing your family members and friends. My mother died from cancer it will be a year Jan 3. I got more of the same non-caring attitude from my new boss and he was pissed off that I was gone for week. I laid into him without crying and told him to go ahead and fire me and I was truly offended by his callousness. Sorry for rambling. Yes, I still smoke but can only deal with the ultra light ones. I have COPD- good reason to stop right! But my stepdad smokes the nastiest generic $3.50 a pack that I can smoke but I wake up wheezing so bad. Real lungburners! 

Hey, like frmr said you can do this. Everyone has their own individual needs in order to stay clean. Eventually you can quit the cigarettes when you're ready. People might say you're trading one substance for another. My son is trying to quit weed and I didn't think it would be such a long drawn-out ordeal. It's been hell for him. But if he wants a cigarette, I'm not going to tell him no. As long as he can test clean when we go to court, I'll be happy.

To be honest, I can't really say I'm clean because I still drink. But I'm working on that too. **hugs**
