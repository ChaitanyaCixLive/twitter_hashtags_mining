Smoking: Is It Worth It?
I just had to start this thread!

I've always contemplated whether smoking was worth it.

I've for many years always enjoyed it but also had many times where it causes me uncontrollable anxiety I have mental health issues and I swear it makes it worse..

But I do enjoy going to the cinema, shopping and having a ball with a packet of cigarettes in my pocket with friends.

But at the same time it does make me nervous, depressed and so forth.

At the moment I am trying to concentrate on swimming/ exercise putting the cigarettes down and starting to become totally clean!

but I do think back to the days when I had my cigarettes and contemplate them with excitement!

It's kind of like a friend, always there when you need them plus when you're dramatically depressed they are a source of enjoyment 

They are a vice of pleausre no doubt! Even if there are serious side effects..

So what do you think, are cigarettes in your opinion worth it?

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
If only all those smokers who want to quit were aware of relatively riskless snuff and oral tobacco that offers more nicotine, more discreetly, for a lower price. 

Or is it that putting tobacco anywhere except the lungs, after turning the plant matter into a carcinogenic cloud is disgusting?

I've never gotten a buzz from a single cigarette but other forms of tobacco provide a buzz in reasonable amounts.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
^^ I don't see how this on thread.

BTW I just started with nicorette patches and while I did buzz heavy for the first few days I rarely get anything anymore and I have to drink a paractemol/ cold remedy (just started) drink to get any euphoria.

And no I don't think smoking is worth it for years it has just caused me anxiety and since I've benn on the patches I've began to feel less mad my head has stopped racing as much and my moods are more controlled.

I still miss it. It is comforting but I'm quite happy to put them down.

For now.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
Hate to sound like I'm no fun, but no - cigarettes are definitely not worth it, for me anyway. I've smoked off and on for 12 years. When I'm smoking I feel guilty and want to stop because it severely compromises my respiratory system. I'm generally happier and feel better about myself in the short stretches where I've managed to not smoke, however smoking is very addictive. When I first started, it gave me a headbuzz. Now i just feel like I need smoke in my lungs at different times throughout the day or I get stressed. 

For some reason, quitting initially isn't that hard when I actually want to - and that's usually because I quit when I get sick from smoking and find it hard to breathe. However, where I live, cigarette use is very common and I have to see it daily, which tends to make me crave. And when I first start smoking again, I get the headbuzz back and don't have any of the respiratory problems, or the frustration at having to always have a pack. 

The head buzz from oral tobacco use is definitely better than cigs. I tried to cut back and eventually quit smoking with oral tobacco. Started with "snus," and developed a tolerance so quickly that a whole pack wouldn't be enough to get me the feeling I wanted. I moved up to bandits, and then to dip. I did quit smoking, but then I started dipping just as much or more than I used to smoke, and in that time I suffered a lot of oral problems. Also I relapsed on cigs again, so for about a month I was dipping AND smoking. I only dipped for a few months and really can't see myself ever picking that up again because its disgusting and also it might actually be more dangerous than smoking with the high rates of oral cancer - plus its so obvious that its dangerous, because it HURTS to dip, it makes my mouth sore and stains my teeth.

I have also bought the gum multiple times and also the electronic cigarettes...just doesn't compare to smoking, and I always relapse. Smoking killed my grandparents who got cancer from it, and I worry that I will have the same fate. I have a quit date planned for "as soon as I finish this next carton," and it will be the thousandth time I've tried to quit, but I'm highly motivated this time and think I might have chance. So in the long run, NAWWWWWW, it's definitely not worth it.

No I agree after smoking for about the same period I too wish I'd never been dragged into them- never done me much good.

Unfortunately when your 14 it just seems so cool- ironic how it drags the life out of ya.

I definately feel slightly better since I stopped I do miss the company but not the anxiety!

It's like I have suddenly woke up after all years and realized them for what they are are- a waste

I've never gotten a buzz from a single cigarette but other forms of tobacco provide a buzz in reasonable amounts.
Ive used snuff and snus to help quit smoking before. it didnt work. at first i was thrilled and didnt smoke a cig for about a month, but i started craving cigs again even though i was still getting nicotine. i think the marketing behind cigs makes them the most addictive form of tobacco. i mean, they're conveniently rolled, conveniently packaged, easy to use quickly, and have the most rush from any form of nicotine. its just hard to forget the pleasure of cigs, even while using other forms of nicotine, IMO. 

id say at this point in my life, smoking is worth it. it gives me a factor in my life that i have authority over, in a sense. for example, if i had a really shitty day, i can kick back an have a cig, and feel a little bit better about the shitty day, because at least i have my cigs. ya know? once i start to feel like shit an get out of breath from standing up, ill probly want to say no, smoking isnt worth it.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
As an ex smoker, who has been smoking for three years a pack per day at least, I have to say that:
Even now, 1.5years after my last pack, I do miss that 'getting out' to have a cig, when all my mates are smoking, and even when I'm alone, that getting out at night, all alone, only with that burning cigarette to think about stuff in complete serenity.
That just proves to me that physical tobacco addiction is only half the story.

My vote has gone to "not sure".

Oh and, of course, I quit because my consciousness always told me that what I was doing was was unhealthy and cost a lot of money, which I didn't always had. This wasn't completely my decision, circumstances made me quit.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
SWIM has never tried smoking tobacco but from what he sees it is just unhealthy, like smoking anything but tobacco produces more tar and is highly adictive. If you aren't concerned about your health it may be worth it but later in life you will regret it. SWIM also has freinds that say that they want to quit but they can't.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
It's not really a yes-no type of question. The thing with cigarettes is moderation is the key. Personally, if I smoke too much in a day 8+ I start to feel guilty, and if I go up to 15+ a day I start to feel dirty AND guilty. It's like being a little kid who ate too many cookies from the cookies jar and is worried about what will happen when his mom finds out. But honestly, it's really not as bad as everyone says it is, depending on the perspective you take. If you enjoy cigarettes, just the act of smoking itself, smoking with friends (smoking brings people closer together, believe it or not), having a smoke after a nice dinner or sex, having a few when you're high or drunk, or on a nice walk outside on a cool clear midnight, it really IS worth it. I've found cigarettes greatly enhance these moments, and there's no regrets. But if you're just sitting on your ass, doing fuck all, and chain smoking cause you're bored - then it's not worth it. 

Bottom line is - smoking and good times compliment each other, unnecessary smoking will make you feel like shit. Pick your battles wisely. You only live once though, and there's a time and place for everything. If the health aspects really warn you, then just don't start; and if you feel guilty every time you smoke, then stop.

Quitting itself is easy though, really all in the mind. It's the triggers and convenience that keeps people hooked.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
I'd say it's worth it. The main reasons I smoke is to help me lose weight/keep my weight down (since I started smoking I've lost about 13 pounds of worthless fat), relax me after a stressful day, and it makes you look cool  I want to live fast/die young because being old doesn't seem very fun. Like abuseforapie said: you only live once, so why not enjoy yourself?

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
All of us partake in the actions we do for our own reasons. 

If your own physical condition is not something you take into consideration, then I wouldn't be too worried about smoking cigarettes. The majority of people live unhealthy lifestyles, whether it's smoking, eating too much fast food, not getting enough exercise, or whatever. Approximately a third of the world's population are forced to live an unhealthy lifestyle because of poverty.

One simple answer is to think about why you make the choice not to value your health, and then consider the compromise that lies with that choice. In other words, is smoking cigarettes really worth more to you than your health?

I do think that it's way too easy to brush aside health and longevity if you are not actually living the experience of physically suffering as a consequence of your own bad habit. I've watched family members die from lung cancer, and it doesn't look pleasant to say the least.

However, and as much as I hate to admit it, I still enjoy smoking cigarettes... And why shouldn't I? I'm always getting lectured: That's going to kill you, you'll stink like cigarettes, your teeth and fingers will turn yellow, you'll die an agonizing death of cancer...

Is the fear of death the main motivation for people not to smoke? Maybe, but I think that an even better reason to avoid smoking, or any other habit which compromises your health, is the prospect of not living while you are still alive.

No one knows exactly how long they are going to last or what exactly is going to take them out, so it makes sense to enjoy life as possible right now. And (unfortunately?) for me, smoking is a part of that.

Right now, I'm still enjoying life. I still have a few things to check off on the bucket list. I'm just not ready. Maybe some day I'll be unlucky enough to be lying there, dying of cancer, and looking back on the list of things that I always wanted to do, but never got the chance thinking, "Oh crap!".

So in other words, yes - smoking cigarettes is worth it to me right now. But I'm also well aware that the day could come to where I deeply regret ever picking up the habit.

See the hypocrisy in my reasoning? I do, and I think it's kind of scary...

Just my honest opinion.

I don't think that's so much hypocrisy as insight and honesty. I felt the same way for years, before having cause to change my evaluation of the worth of smoking (open heart surgery which hurt for months afterwards). 

The thought of having another heart attack scares me, another would probably kill me and the pain was indescribable. I'd like at least a few more years of reasonable quality life, which I know I won't get if I smoke. 

Tobacco and smoking are a drug and route of administration that just about guarantee misery sooner or later. It's a shame that addiction prevents us from holding this view with conviction until some damage has been done. For me right now, smoking is just not worth it.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
I think it depends entirely on what you get out of it, and how addictive you personally find nicotine to be.

I've never been addicted to tobacco, never allowed myself to use it to a point where I felt a craving for it. If I thought for one second I wouldn't be able to stop, I'd never touch another cig. 

But....I feel like crap if I smoke more than a few cigs in a row, and I know it's bad for my health so I space out my use. In a psychoactive sense, it's certainly not my DOC, but I like the taste/smell of cloves and good quality tobacco, so I smoke it for that too.

"Worth it" is a vague description. As drugs go, I'd say things like LSD and opioids are much more "worth it" when you compare health risks and psychoactive benefits. If you're able to smoke in moderation, go for it....but most people can't. A close friend of mine has angina and suffered a serious heart attack....and still can't seem to quit smoking. For her, starting definitely wasn't worth it.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
I smoked for a few years a awhile back, so stupid of me.
when i tried to quit the first time I made it almost two days, and a cigarette sounded like it would make me feel so much better, so i smoked one. when i finished it i rememember thinking "do I feel any better? what did that cigarette do for me?"
it made me feel like i cheated myself and the cravings I had those two days were for nothing now. 
I threw that full pack I just bought out the window of my car and that was the last cigarette I have had since. its been 7 years now since I have had one and i find them repulsive. I had a boyfreind for a while that was a smoker, i was scared I might pick them up agian but I didnt. before I kissed him though every time i would litterally shove a stick of gum in his mouth, which isnt very sexy, none the less we dated for 3-4 months, I told him by month two he needs to quit or I would have to call it off , he said he quit, but kept smoking/ hiding it. so i dumped him
cigarettes are not sexy, when I see people smoke I think "why are they doing that to themselves ??" must not have much self esteem/ self worth. Obviously dont care abolut their health or hygeine. 
sad

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
Smoking a cigarette when you have no tolerance - definitely worth it.

Smoking a cigarette because you have to every two hours, even though you will be breathing heavy on your way back from that break, even though you have non-smoker friends/family that will be waiting for you on your break....no not worth it.

I smoke dokha tobacco now, even though it's just as addictive i smoke way less plant material and it costs $25/month to keep my habit up.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
I don't think that smoking is as bad for your health as all the anti-smokers make it out to be, but no i still don't think its worth it...for myself at least. If i didn't have anxiety problems though, then im sure it might be worth it. Smoking nowadays though just makes me extremely anxious and jittery. I've been smoking for three years though and haven't been able to quit yet, even though i have the desire to do so. They really are quite addictive after you've been smoking alot for a long time period. There are certain occasions though where i do truly love having a cig....during a work break for instance, or when im really pissed off then a cig will help to calm me down.

And as far as smokeless tobacco being "relatively riskless" like another poster stated, i don't agree. Sure, its probably tons better for your health than smoking is, but it still comes with its own risks. When i was in rehab there was a man in there that developed gum cancer in his teenage years from dipping. His teeth are more or less little tiny nubs now, but he still continued to dip. I realize that smoking has more of a chance to cause mouth cancer than oral tobacco, but theres still that chance. I say this as i have a wad of copenhagen in my mouth too btw

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
I've made a lot of friends through smoking cigs. But I made a lot more smoking ganja. I'd say no, it isn't worth it. The health and monetary costs are just too high for something with so little takeaway.

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
Well I've quit now 4 three weeks and tbh is feeling alot better.

This time he actually feels he's done it other times whn he quit before he always felt like he needed one every few days to fix himself now he's like whatever, although he still craves occaisonly.

Funny thing is he can now go to his city centre and not crave and as of before when he had to have a cig and a coffee when in the big smoke and enjoy it tbf as of the last few weeks he's been alot happier going into crowds/ crowded places and can actually walk around reasonably and I see reasonably contented in fact I swear his thought process has improved since he quit. He used to think massive amounts when smoking to the point where he couldnt catch his breath due to the speed of his thought now it's calmed down a bit and he enjoys a more peaceful style of dreaming which allows him to make his plans better  

So ya considering I used to believe smoking used to make me think better I can now see that is a lie as my mood and thoughts have become more controlled since stopping and I am happy for that!

Unfortuanetly quitting the fags haven't smoothed out all the little faults my mind carry's but they certainly increase depression/ anxiety in ppl with mental health probelms IMO So Quit! It helps

Absolutely not, vaping or smokeless tobacco has more worth for the harm ratio IMO but I still wish I never walked down the Nicotine Road

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
No, I smoked about 6-7 years it was a pain to quit smells bad, costs money...and honestly what do you even get out of it?? I mean if you are one of those people who can smoke a cig every once in a while go ahead but if I was there again I'd keep walking

Re: Smoking: Is It Worth It?
I would say definitely not worth it, but yet I continue to do so. My thinking is if I stop now in my 30's, I give myself a stronger chance to still enjoy life say in my 50's, 60's etc, i.e. have sex, be mobile and active. So I am going to try my hardest this time around, plus it's expensive, £8 a day just for 20, and I dislike rolling my own.
