Default 5.80 for pack of Marlboros today, omg
Wow, so I guess this tax increase went in effect today, because surely enough the marlboros that I used to buy for like 4.20 a pack today, I had to pay 5.80 for the same pack of marlboros that I usually buy, this is an outrage!

Sounds like that increase is a combo of the 70-cent increase PM applied to all of their brands for March, and maybe a tax increase for your area. I heard of some states raising their state taxes on cigs.

The fed tax will come on April 1st. Based on that $5.80 price you paid, the fed tax increase will make that Marlboro pack $6.40 for you in a month from now.

Look on the bright side. At least your pack is cheaper than a Marlboro pack by me. If you think $5.80 is an outrage, imagine trying to pay 8-9 bucks for one pack!

marlboros and all cigarettes going up $7/carton for sure on April 1st...if you go to youtube, there's a parody of a guy smoking claiming he's helping to support healthcare for kids, b/c if it wasn't for us SMOKERS, our kids wouldn't have subsidized healthcare! LOL

With an injector machine (Topomatic), I get approx 15 packs or better out of a pound of RYO tobacco. At $17.00/lb plus tubes, it works out to around $1.30/pack. It is proposed that $20 tax will be added to lb bags in april. That works out to about $2.75/pack which is still cheaper than commercial cigs.

Gambler and Premier are pretty good inexpensive RYO tobaccos for everyday smoking and inject well with a machine. There are others. A guy can experiment with full flavor and turkish blends and maybe find something close to Marlboro. If not, get used to a blend that tastes decent and your taste buds adjust.

Just small corrections:

The RYO/MYO tax increase you refer to is actually 24 bucks per 1 pound of tobacco. And this isn't a "proposed" tax. This is a tax which will be applied to loose tobacco for sure. The tax increase even applies to smokeless tobacco and cigars.

No lying on a carton of MYOs still being cheaper than 70-90 bucks for a premade carton!

Marlboro's are hovering around $6.00 around my area. I feel like I'm in New York.

Default Price of Marlboro in Virginia
Marlboro's just went up here too. I used to pay $31 a carton and yesterday they cost $42. That's an $11.00 increase and the dude behind the counter said they were going up again soon! Ridiculous.

With the $1.50 off a pack, I paid $3.01 for Marlboro 100s, but I'm pretty sure all Marlboro brands were on sale. I think they're going to be about $5.22 plus tax after today's WV tax increase.
