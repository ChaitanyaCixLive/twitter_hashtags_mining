Add some bourbon to it. It'll kill what's bad for you in the Coke.

I can't get past the smell of bourbon. Back in my drinking days I would mix Coke with Meyers rum. Loved that stuff. Too much really. Vodka was another favorite, though it was more of a breakfast drink

I only drink beer and only on Saturdays. Belgian style Maudite dark strong ale from Unibroue last time. Good stuff. Ive experimented trying to blend up tobacco to match different beers in a way but only limited sucess. Something with chocolate malt in it like stout etc. might be good with chocolate/cocoa topped tobacco. Once I made a blend that reminded me of Vienna lager in a way. Heck if I can remember how I accomplished that. Looking for a good bock beer but there just isnt many out there. German style Pilsner is great in summer but its cold out now.

I know it may sound ridiculous but there is some basic info online on pairing beverages with pipe tobacco so why not cigarettes too. I recall reading about a dark strong ale that had pipe tobacco listed in flavor profile. Cant remember what it was. Might be better off pairing the beverages to the tobacco rather than the tobacco to the beverage.
